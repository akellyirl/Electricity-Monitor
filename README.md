# Electricity-Monitor
An Electricity Monitor for Arduino Yun or Particle Photon

This will show you how to make an Electricity Monitor for your home that utilises some of the key capabilities of the Arduino Yun or Particle Photon that make them a great choice for Cloud Enabled sensor projects such as this.

Features :

    WiFi connection allows continuous monitoring of Power Consumed
    Utilises TEMBOO for Cloud Support with Google APIs
    Cloud Support: Writes Power Consumption to a Google Drive Spreadsheet
    Graphing, analysis etc.. available via Google Spreadsheet

A nice feature of the project is that the monitoring is flexible and it's completely wireless (except for the Current Transformer of course), allowing continuous monitoring from a PC or phone and permanent storage on the Cloud.

Measured accuracy was 6% (typical), which is excellent for such a simple circuit. Even better accuracy was observed after calibration.
